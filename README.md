Bike Sharing Assignment
Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a dock which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Business Goal:
Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

In the dataset provided, you will notice that there are three columns named casual', 'registered', and 'cnt'. The variable 'casual' indicates the number casual users who have made a rental. The variable 'registered' on the other hand shows the total number of registered users who have made a booking on a given day. Finally, the 'cnt' variable indicates the total number of bike rentals, including both casual and registered. The model should be built taking this cnt' as the target variable.

Steps Involved

Reading,Understanding and Visualising the data
Preparing the data for modelling (train-test-split, rescaling etc)
Training the model/Build Model Using Automated + Manual Approach
Residual Analysis
Predictions and Evaluation of test set
